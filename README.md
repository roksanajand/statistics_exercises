# Statistics exercises
This repository contains exercises in statistics completed during my second year of studies. The tasks cover fundamental and advanced topics in probability theory, random variables, and statistical analysis. Each folder represents a set of problems focused on specific theoretical concepts and their practical applications.
### cwl1: Discrete Random Variable Distributions

1. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**
   - Constructed a discrete probability distribution table for random variable \(X\) (`r1p`), showing values and their probabilities.

2. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
   - Created a cumulative distribution table for random variable \(X\) (`r1f`), representing intervals and cumulative probabilities.

3. **Visualization of PMF and CDF:**
   - Plotted the PMF and CDF of \(X\) using the `vizualize_discrete_distribution()` function.

4. **Statistical Parameters:**
   - Calculated key parameters of the \(X\) distribution:
     - Mean (\(r1\_mean\)),
     - Variance (\(r1\_var\)),
     - Standard Deviation (\(r1\_std\)).

5. **Binomial Distribution:**
   - Constructed the PMF (`r2p`) and CDF (`r2f`) for a binomial random variable \(Y\) and visualized both using plots.
   - Calculated mean (\(r2\_mean\)), variance (\(r2\_var\)), and standard deviation (\(r2\_std\)) for \(Y\).

6. **Poisson Distribution:**
   - Constructed the PMF (`r3p`) and CDF (`r3f`) for a Poisson random variable \(Z\) and visualized both using plots.
   - Calculated mean (\(r3\_mean\)), variance (\(r3\_var\)), and standard deviation (\(r3\_std\)) for \(Z\).

7. **Probability Calculations:**
   - Computed and visualized probabilities for specific events:
     - \( P(X > 5) \),
     - \( P(1 < Y <= 6) \),
     - \( P(Z <= 12 \,|\, Z > 21) \).
