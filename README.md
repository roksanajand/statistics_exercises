     - Allowed repeated sampling of individuals.
     - Saved result in `sample_2`.
   - **Scenario 3:**
     - Randomly sampled 200 individuals without replacement from the population, simulating a crowd-based survey where respondents cannot answer more than once.
     - Saved result in `sample_3`.

     - Ensured no duplicates and saved result in `sample_4`.
   - **Scenario 5:**
     - Stratified sampling proportional to the population size of each sector.
     - Sampled 25% of the population from each sector without replacement.
     - Saved result in `sample_5`.
   - **Scenario 6:**
     - Cluster sampling: Randomly selected 4 buses and included all passengers in those buses in the sample.
     - Saved result in `sample_6`.

 **Strengths and Weaknesses of Sampling Methods:**
   - **Scenario 1:**
     - Strengths: Efficient and straightforward implementation.
     - Weaknesses: May not represent the diversity of the entire population.
   - **Scenario 2:**
     - Strengths: Simple and quick.
     - Weaknesses: Repeated individuals reduce sample diversity.
   - **Scenario 3:**
     - Strengths: Ensures diverse sampling by avoiding duplicates.
     - Weaknesses: Randomization may still miss certain population segments.
   - **Scenario 4:**
     - Strengths: Equal representation from all sectors ensures balance.
     - Weaknesses: Potentially labor-intensive in execution.
   - **Scenario 5:**
     - Strengths: Proportional representation ensures sample mirrors population structure.
     - Weaknesses: Implementation complexity increases with population stratification.
   - **Scenario 6:**
     - Strengths: Captures all individuals within randomly selected clusters.
     - Weaknesses: May exclude other clusters, reducing overall diversity.

 2. **Part 1: Representativeness Analysis**
   - Evaluated the representativeness of four provided random samples drawn from a population with \( N(172, 7) \).
   - Observations:
     - Sample 1 had a positively skewed distribution and lower variance than the population.
     - Sample 2 was less dispersed, with multiple peaks, showing reduced concentration around the mean.
     - Sample 3 closely mirrored the population's parameters, being the most representative.
     - Sample 4 exhibited the highest variance, with extreme outliers causing positive skewness.

3. **Part 2: Representativeness Analysis**
   - Evaluated 5000 samples (size 100 each) drawn from a population with \( N(172, 7) \), analyzing:
     - **Mean Distribution:**
       - Symmetrical around the population mean, suggesting high representativeness.
     - **Variance Distribution:**
       - Slightly asymmetric with values skewed, indicating occasional samples with outliers.
     - **Standard Deviation Distribution:**
       - Symmetrical and concentrated around the population's standard deviation (\( 7 \)).
   - **Conclusions:**
     - Representativeness depends on how well samples capture the population's diversity.
     - Larger sample sizes reduce variability, enhancing representativeness and analysis accuracy.
